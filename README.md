# Simple One-Variable Regression with PyTorch

## Overview
This is a simple, one-variable Machine Learning regression project. My goal with this project is to **learn PyTorch** through **project-based learning**.  

## Learning Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, and neural networks.  
- Explore building a regression model from scratch, and possibly in **pure Python**, to see how PyTorch works from first principles.  

## Project Description
In this project, I predict a single continuous variable based on one input feature. Through this, I aim to learn:  
- How to define a model in PyTorch  
- How to calculate loss and gradients  
- How to perform backpropagation and optimize parameters  

## Future Steps
- Extend the project to multiple input features.  
- Build more complex networks for multi-output regression or time series prediction.
